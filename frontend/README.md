Student Productivity (Vanilla)
=============================

This is a simple conversion of the React-based Student Productivity UI into a vanilla HTML/JS project.
Features implemented:
- Dashboard navigation (static cards)
- Tasks management (add, toggle done) persisted to localStorage
- Finance (add income/expense, list, delete) persisted to localStorage
- Roadmap planner (add, delete) persisted to localStorage
- Pomodoro timer (25 minutes) basic start/pause/reset
- Browser notifications (uses Notification API) for deadlines and low balance checks

How to use:
1. Unzip the project.
2. Open index.html in your browser.
3. Allow notifications when requested if you want desktop notifications.

Notes:
- This is a lightweight single-file frontend project. No server needed.
- If you want a ZIP with more assets or a build system, tell me and I can extend it.
